# Real-Time Audio Descrambler


## About 

The objectives of this scenario are to

* Work out how the scrambling is done by recording your own voice and analysing the scrambled message produced by the scrambling program “The scrambler file” written in the protected Matlab code.

* Design and build a digital real-time audio descrambler to work out what the secret message is using both MATLAB and C.
